## Hi, I'm Bahareh Amirshahi 👋 👩‍💻 👩‍🎓 🇮🇷 🇨🇦

I am a data science professional specialized in predictive modeling using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. I have a PhD in Business Analytics from John Molson School of Business, Concordia University. Over the past three years, I have conducted several data science research projects within the finance domain. In my PhD thesis, I integrated various algorithms and developed new feature engineering methods to extract high-quality data from diverse sources. This approach led to performance improvements of up to 20% in predicting cryptocurrency market trends, prices, and volatility.
