## Hi there 👋, I'm Bahareh Amirshahi. 

<!--
**BaharehAm/BaharehAm** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a data science professional 👩‍💻 specialized in predictive modelling using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. I have a PhD in Business Analytics 👩‍🎓 have conducted several data science research projects within the finance domain. In my PhD thesis, I integrated various algorithms and developed new feature engineering methods to extract high-quality data from diverse sources. This approach led to performance improvements of up to 20% in predicting cryptocurrency market trends, prices, and volatility. 

I have taught SAS, Python, Excel, and Tableau to hundreds of students at Concordia University. Additionally, I have over four years of experience in software development industry. As an ERP Business Analyst, I was involved in delivering software solutions to clients in an agile environment, created financial reports using SQL and report designer tools, managed and analyzed customer data using SQL Server.
