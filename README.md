## Hi there 👋, I'm Bahareh Amirshahi.

I am a data science professional 👩‍💻 specialized in predictive modeling using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. I have a Ph.D. in Business Analytics 👩‍🎓 and have conducted several data science research projects within the finance domain. In my PhD thesis, I integrated various algorithms and developed new feature engineering methods to extract high-quality data from diverse sources. This approach led to performance improvements of up to 20% in predicting cryptocurrency market trends, prices, and volatility.

I have taught SAS, Python, Excel, and Tableau to hundreds of students at Concordia University. Additionally, I have over four years of experience in the software development industry. As an ERP Business Analyst, I was involved in delivering software solutions to clients in an agile environment, created financial reports using SQL and report designer tools, and managed and analyzed customer data using SQL Server.
